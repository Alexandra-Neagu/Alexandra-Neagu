👩🏻‍🎓 I'm a second-year student with a knack for mathematics pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering at TU Delft.

💻 I have lengthy experience in C++, Java, C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and pgSQL, and have worked with frameworks, engines, and RDBMSs such as Springboot, JUnit, Mockito, Jqwik, Unity, and PostgreSQL.
I am especially passionate about backend development in Java and database development.

⬆️ Currently on my way to learning Python, Scala, and Unix and getting familiar with Big Data Processing and Machine Learning. Also self-learning the Dutch language.

📸 I practice photography and Photoshop retouching as a hobby. I enjoy portrait photography and capturing spontaneous compositions, as I believe any expression and moment, as small as it may seem now, could become a fond memory in the future, and I'm here to immortalize it just in case.
